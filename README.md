# Politician AI

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Nowadays it is hard to keep up with all the important things in life. One of those things is politics. Would it be nice just to check all the relevant info and maybe ask a machine who to vote in the next elections? 


## Background

Problem 1
To bring light in the desicion making roulette in politics. Data about salaries or "fees", hospitality-money, presence in congress and every other public information there is can be easily compiled onto one application or web page. Citizen can read the hard data* behind their politicians and what they have achieved with tax payer money. *The hard data will be transferred into easily readable form

Problem 2
To aid in election voting. AI can ground collected data and point out the best candidates for you to vote. This way even if you have not been into politics you still can make a difference by voting the most suitable candidate for you. The AI can be trained to learn tricks and ticks how to combine different preferences between people. 

Problem 3
Make the congress work more effectively. There is no place for bullshit when the data is always there. If politician have not achieved the promises made in electional campaign it will come up in data and pointed out in next election.

All problems above are more or less on the table every other year when it comes to election-year. There are people that just do not feel the need to keep up with the news considering the congress matters. This gives a slack for politicians because their best energy is put to electional campaign when people are thinking who to vote. After election when the real work should start, politicians tend to fall in hibernation since they allready got into congress. 

## How is it used?

The user is a person who wants to know more than beautiful phrases of the politicians. A citizen, journalist or police.

Phase 1
Web page oriented congress database. The data is all there in easily readable form. There is data of all the politicians so the user can also compare politicians in congress with the ones out. The front page of the site could be formatted full of news and hot topics of the day. There is side bars that help the user to navigate. There is filters that can be ticked to only give inormation that the user needs. The main idea is that data is for everyone.

Phase 2
Web page is presented with user login, point out, this was not in the Phase 1. In this phase the user can create user identification. With identificated user, the user now can mold the page more to his/hers/its own liking. For example, the front page can now keep the information the user wants to see first, the user can mark politicians for monitoring and the user can create alarms that notify when the parameters are met. In this pahse comes also the AI driven election 

Phase 3
Implementation for application. In this phase, the heavy users are getting more user friendly application. In this phase the users become masters. They can have their own word in chat. They can point out news they see important. They can put politicians under control label and those politicians will have extra eyes.


## Data sources and AI methods

Most governments have a web site that can be used to collect the starting database for todays information. In most countries this kind of information is public, so there is no reason why not to collect your own database from these archives. Every new data coming in day in day out must be verified before storing it. The key in this idea is that it is hard data only represented in readable form and the data must be exact. The data collecting itself should be given for AI. The AI then must have different methods: NLP, nearest neighbor, regressions and so on.

## Challenges

This idea only gives the opportunity for user to read the data, it does not make the user to read it. This kind of databank is only a good solution for unknowing people if they use it. It is not also bulletproof for making the congress more efficient, which in the end is in the hand of the people.

## What next?

In the ultimately far future, this kind of system with enough trainded AI could be used to predict what comes from differently seated congresses. The AI could be given different tasks, for example where we as humans want to take our community, and the AI could calculate the best solution and decision makers.
